# Vegha: Smart Traffic Management Dashboard

Vegha is a comprehensive, real-time web dashboard for monitoring and managing urban traffic flow. It serves as the frontend for the AI-Powered Traffic Management System, providing a rich, interactive user experience.

Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, Vegha is designed to be modern, responsive, and performant.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Main Dashboard**: At-a-glance overview of system status, key metrics like active junctions, total vehicles, ongoing events, and system alerts.
-   **Live Map View**: Real-time visualization of junctions, traffic congestion levels, AI-powered predictions, and active events on an interactive Leaflet map.
-   **Live Simulation Control**: An embedded, interactive interface to view and control a live SUMO simulation, powered by a backend WebSocket server. Users can manage the simulation and trigger events like closing streets.
-   **Event Management**: A detailed log to track and manage traffic-related incidents, including construction, accidents, public gatherings, and weather alerts.
-   **Emergency Vehicle Tracking**: A dedicated panel to monitor the real-time status, location, and routes of active emergency vehicles.
-   **AI-Powered Predictions**: Displays traffic forecasts, expected wait times, and congestion predictions generated by the federated reinforcement learning model.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with App Router)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **Charting**: [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)
-   **Mapping**: [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) & [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
-   **Real-time Communication**: [Socket.IO Client](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/)
-   **UI Components**: Built with custom components and [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for icons.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the Vegha dashboard locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v20.x or later)
-   The [SUMO Server](../sumo_server/) from the parent project must be running to power the live simulation page.

### 1. Installation

Navigate to the `Vegha` directory and install the required dependencies.

```bash
bun install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configuration

For local development, the application is configured to connect to the backend server at `http://localhost:5000`. If your backend runs on a different URL, create a `.env.local` file in this directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_IO_URL=http://your-backend-url:5000
```

### 3. Running the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
bun run dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🌐 Data Sources

The Vegha UI is powered by two main data sources:

1.  **Static JSON Data**: For pages like the main dashboard, events, and predictions, the application fetches data from mock JSON files located in the `/public/data` directory. This allows the UI to be demonstrated without a fully operational backend.
2.  **Live Socket.IO Stream**: The "Simulation" page establishes a real-time WebSocket connection to the `sumo_server` backend to stream live vehicle data, metrics, and enable interactive controls.
